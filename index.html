          <p>You just have it in the way you talk. So sweet, so gentle, so genuine. You are one of the bestest speakers I've ever met. The way you talk, your body language; Mashallah! 0_0</p>
          <p>You put things on the table the way they are. You don't sugarcoat it, you don't manipulate it. You always stand up for what's wrong. You know how to take care of yourself and others. You always make sure that you're looking good :) You always smell nice :p and you never fail to amaze me.(you can take this otherwise too lol)! </p>

          <p class="flow-text indigo-text text-darken-4">HIDDEN MSG 1</p>
          <p>I'll describe the first day I met you, your first impression. So, tbh, I couldn't recognize you. You looked different in real life than reel life. I started smiling as soon as I saw you. The way you said "hi" I was like ummmmm okay, okay. I still don't remember how time flew away. Like, it was just 30 mins since I met you? You remember you stayed? You didn't go early. And somewhere in between all those talks and laughs, I knew something was there in stock for us <3</p>
          <p>Now comes the first time we went out. I WAS SOOOOO NERVOUS! You made me wait that day too :( But yeah, whatever. Moving on, remember how we went to some alien ass street with fucking cows and buffalos? With people staring at us? and then a series of you pushing me back to back and holding on to me again. Then where did we go? I still would like to call it a waterbody that was behind us and not a fucking drainage. How sly are youuu? sitting sitting you were making a mastermind plan to kiss me? well, appreciate you for that. Gonna give this one to you yeah. So, Mr. Syed Imran, that kiss turned out to be the best kiss of my life. So beautiful, so mellow, so sweet that even you yourself can't kiss me like that again. It was a one time kiss, once in a lifetime kind. Ahhhh. Ik that you're living all of this in your mind as you're reading this. Enjoy, cutie!</p>

        <div class="col s12" id="note2">
          <p class="flow-text indigo-text text-darken-4">HIDDEN MSG 2</p>
          <p>So here, I'm gonna tell you how I was feeling when I saw you for the last time. Man, that still has to be one of the saddest days of my life. I was not ready to leave you. I wanted some more time to tell myself that that this is happening. It was all so sudden yes? The thought that this is the last time I'm seeing you b4 a fucking 2.5 months break, made me so sad. I was just crying if you remember. Couldn't hug you properly, couldn't kiss you properly. VIT SUXX!</p>
          <p>The next time I see you...first of all I can't wait for that next time to come. This distance is eating me up but yeah we sure as fuck are getting through this. So, coming back, the next time I see you,I'm just going to give you a tight, warm and world's most coziest hug! we'll have a good beauty sesh, a good bathing sesh and surely a good makeout sesh! Now stop! don't think about it. It's still a surprise for you *wink wink*!</p>

          <p>You're 19 years old. Damn, still a small number for me lol. But yes, not for you or your parents. You're 19 babe. Things are gonna change a slight bit, parents are gonna expect some more from you and I'm sure you're gonna fulfill all those expectations. I just want you to be a better person with every day passing by. I'm gonna work with you for that. I want you to take care of yourself, I want you you get a bit serious towards your life and your goals. Also, exams are coming up, we gotta prep, yeah? Okay so enough of serious talks, lets's move forward!</p>
          <p>Also, today's your day. I want you to cook something for yourself, talk to all those people you wanna talk to, watch your favourite show, workout a bit if you feel like and if you can, bake a cake for yourself? i'll tell you how to. I know this quarantine sucks, I know it'd have been a lot more better if this wasn't happening but still, I'm still gonna be there with you on your b'day. So what if there's distance, it's nothing. I love you my champ!

          <p>The first thing I can think of is PONDIIII. Remember you had to take a dump so bad and when you finally got to do it...NO WATER! HAHAHAHAHAHA. How you came outta the washroom clean, is still a suspense for me. How you called me from there? "Yo, Shrishti can you please go to the reception and tell them that there's no water?"</p>
          <p>Next, "I suck, but atleast I'm good at it" Ahem...not gonna elaborate this one :)</p>

          <p class="flow-text indigo-text text-darken-4">SUMMARY</p>
          <p>Hey, although I have a lot of stuff to write about over here but I'm gonna keep it short rn. You literally mean a fuck load to me. I've loved you in a way I haven't loved anyone else, and I'll continue doing that. I know your flaws and your weaknesses and trust me, I'm never gonna use any of that against you. I promise I'll always be your go to person and that I'll always take care of you. The happiness, the sorrows, the difficulties that we've faced together, no one else I would want to share them with CAUSE all of this, feels right, just with you. There's no one else I'd want to miss, no one else I'll want to kiss, no one else I'll want to give the last slice of my pizza, no one else I'd want to call in the middle of the night, no one else I'd want to give the half of my raspberry duet, no one else I'd like to drop till their class, no one else I'd wanna give my heart to, no one else I'll want to kiss badly when they're mad at me and no one else I'll find cute every time I'm looking at them. It's all just for you. It will all always be just for you. Period.</p>
          <p>So yeah, It'll take you maybe 10 mins to go through this complete site but ik that you're gonna cherish it for 10 light years :p To my one and only, HAPPY BIRTHDAY IMMUTARA!! I miss you a lot!</p>
